I developed this magic system in high school. It could be used as the basis for a story or game. <a href="/img/Glyphs.pdf"><img src="/img/glyphs thumb.png"></a>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/glyphs.png" alt="" title="many glyphs"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Many of the glyphs described in the document.
</div>
