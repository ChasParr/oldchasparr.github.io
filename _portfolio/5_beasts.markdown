The world of Beasts is a fantasy/sci-fi world I created in high school.  It involves a large planet and its two planet-sized moons. There are 13 main intelligent species: Swinls, Humans, Torino, Inaer, Rit, Aereon, Tsla, Vrenn, Smashers, Smelters, Pickn, and Hutepni. There are three gods: Light, Darkness, and Kartogg, but none of them care about "mortals" and Light and Darkness have been powerless since the end of the Great War...
