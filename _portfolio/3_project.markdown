For my 3D Animation class for our final we did a group project with a number of models and animations. The animation I was responsible for was a swimming fish.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/fishAnim2.gif" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
