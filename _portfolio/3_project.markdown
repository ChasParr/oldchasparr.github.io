For my 3D Animation class for our final we did a group project with a number of models and animations. The animation I was responsible for was a swimming fish.

<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/fishAnim2.gif" alt="" title="example image"/>

The model and animation are both mine, the texture was done by my group member Julia Wessen.
