During the summer of 2015, I designed and implemented [Evolving Algae](http://blog.umd.edu/algaeevolve/), a Wordpress blog for University of Maryland biology professor Dr. Charles Delwiche to showcase the activities of his laboratory. I used this project to become familiar with Wordpress. This is an example of my interest in biology, which I currently plan to add as a minor. The collaboration with Dr. Delwiche worked especially well because of my background in evolution and biology. 

The theme I used was [WPstart](https://wordpress.org/themes/wpstart/).
