During the summer of 2015, I designed and implemented [Evolving Algae](http://blog.umd.edu/algaeevolve/), a Wordpress blog for University of Maryland biology professor Dr. Charles Delwiche to showcase the activities of his laboratory.  

The theme I used was [WPstart](https://wordpress.org/themes/wpstart/).
