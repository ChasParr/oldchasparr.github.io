During the summer of 2015, I designed and implemented [Evolving Algae](http://blog.umd.edu/algaeevolve/), a Wordpress blog for University of Maryland biology professor Dr. Charles Delwiche to showcase the activities of his laboratory.  

Something cool about the site. Something I learned.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	On the left, something. Middle, something more. Right, something final.
</div>

<br/><br/><br/>

I used the template X. I made the following modifications. Here's a snippet of code, for example.

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
